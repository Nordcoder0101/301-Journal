Codewars is the shizznit!!  What a fun website, I can't wait to dig into more of these challenges, and with my competitve nature, leaderboards make me drool.

As far as the HTML CSS portion of the assignments, this is still a challenge for me.  For some reason, basic CSS concepts are not sticking.  I could pass a multiple choice test for what things do in CSS, but making it work feels more difficult than maybe it should be.  

Working with Koko was cool.  Thankfully she was pretty strong in CSS and she took the lead on this morning's project.  I was stronger in the coding side and was able to take the lead in the codewars challenge.  Overall good dynamics I'd say.
