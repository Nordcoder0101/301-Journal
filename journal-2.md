Journal 2 for 301

301 has been pretty cool so far, been pretty fun learning more efficient ways to do what we learned in 201.  I have really enjoyed the codewars, and pair programming.  I have been in a pair where I was the stronger coder and had to lead the process, and today I was working with Steve who was beyond my skillset.  It's been great working with Steve to see how he works through things and catching on to his logic.

On a personal level, other than needing sleep, feeling good about everything!
